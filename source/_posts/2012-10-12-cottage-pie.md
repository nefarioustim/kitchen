Cottage Pie
===========

Cottage Pie (or Shepherd's Pie, which these days tends to mean a lamb mince alternative) is a pie filled with minced beef and topped with a mash potato crust. It's a British classic and is a firm favourite in our household. What's more it's inherently gluten-free (unless you use something nasty to thicken the sauce).

Mrs Beeton describes it as a means of using leftover roasted meat of any kind, and lines the pie dish with mashed potato as well as having a mashed potato crust on top. Personally, I favour a beef sauce, flavoured with root vegetables and tomato, and a nice cheesy-mash crust for added yummy.

Takes about 45 minutes to make plus 45 minutes in the oven.

Serves 4-6 depending on how hungry you all are.

### Mashed potato crust

* 1.5kg Potatoes
* 50g Lightly Salted Butter
* 1 tbsp Crème fraîche
* Salt and Pepper

### Pie filling

* 2 tsp Olive Oil
* 1 Onion
* 3 Cloves of Garlic
* 2 Carrots
* 2 Sticks of Celery
* 500g Beef Mince
* 1 Tin of Peeled Plum Tomatoes
* 1 Beef Stock Cube
* 2 tbsp Worcestershire Sauce
* ½ tsp Marmite
* 4 heaped tsp of Corn Flour
* Salt and Pepper

Preparation
-----------

Prepare the mashed potato crust:

1. Peel the potatoes and halve them. Chop the halves into quarters and cover them in boiling water. Add a pinch of salt, and bring back to the boil. Start preparing the filling whilst you wait for the potatoes to cook. Simmer until they are soft and then drain. Check them periodically by prodding them with a fork.
1. Add the butter and crème fraîche to the potato and begin to mash. Once the potatoes have broken down a little, add the cheese and pepper and continue to mash until smooth.

Prepare the filling:

1. Peel the carrots and chop them, the onion, the sticks of celery, and the garlic into a fine dice.
1. Heat the oil in a large pan. Add the onion and turn down the heat. Fry gently. Once the onion has turned translucent, add the carrot, celery, and garlic and continue to fry until the onion starts to brown.
1. Add the mince and brown. Turn down the heat and add crumble in the beef stock cube. Now add the Worcestershire Sauce. Pour in the tin of tomatoes and stir. Fill half the tin with water and also add to the pan.
1. Let the mixture come back to the boil and gently break up the tomatoes using the back of a wooden spoon and the side of the pan. Mix in the Marmite, and season the sauce to taste with the salt and pepper. Simmer for 15-20 minutes until the sauce has reduced to just covering the meat and vegetables.
1. In a separate cup, mix the corn flour with cold water to make a corn-starch thickener. Once the corn flour has dissolved into the water, pour the mixture into the sauce pot and stir in; this will thicken the gravy of the sauce.

Make the pie:

1. Pour the filling into a large oven-proof dish.
1. Spoon the mashed potato on top of the sauce. You'll need to start from the edges and work your way in, otherwise the potato will sink into the sauce. Once the dish is covered in a nice thick layer of mashed potato, smooth it over with the back of the spoon to make sure it's well covered and then drag the tips of a fork lightly over the top to create a cross-hatch pattern. This will roughen up the mash on top and give it a textured crust which will crisp up during cooking.
2. Place in the oven at 180ºC/350ºF/gas 4 for approximately 45 minutes, or until the top is golden and crispy.

Enjoy!
